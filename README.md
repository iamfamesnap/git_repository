TripleTen Sprint 4  Software Development Project


This project is a data visualization tool designed to help users explore and analyze data by visualizing random events such as the distribution of vehicle prices, mileage, and other attributes. It uses Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface where users can toggle between different visualizations to gain insights into the vehicle data. 

The tool leverages data science libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly Express for dynamic, interactive visuals. This tool makes it ideal for users looking to explore the distribution of vehicle attributes like price, odometer readings, condition, and more with minimal setup and effort. 

Tools and Libraries Used: 
Pandas
Plotly Express
Streamlit

How to Use the Tool
Main Dashboard: After opening the app, the default view will show a histogram of vehicle prices or odometer readings, depending on checkbox selection. 

Use the checkbox to toggle between the price and odometer histograms. 
Additional scatterplots and histograms, such as those showing relationships between vehicle conditions and car types or days listed and manufacturers, will be displayed based on user interaction.
